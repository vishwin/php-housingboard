PHP-HOUSINGBOARD
================

â€¦is a concept of a collegiate housing board, done Craigslist-style,
implemented in PHP. This was my submission for my PHP practical course's
final project.

It uses MySQL for much of the data backend, with Gravatar to provide
email-based profile pics. The user interface uses Zurb Foundation.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------
This project was originally developed on:
* Apache 2.4
* PHP 5.5
* MariaDB 5.5.37
I have not tested this on other versions of the above software, but it
should work with at least Apache 2.2, PHP 5.1 and MySQL 5.1.
